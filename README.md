# Ledger for Obsidian

Personal finance tracking and planning, from the comfort of Obsidian! All of
your data is stored in plain text, and interoperable with any tool which
supports the [Ledger CLI](https://www.ledger-cli.org). Stop giving away your
personal financial information to online sites that sell your data. Store it
safely in your Obsidian Vault instead.

## Features

- [x] Widget to quickly input expenses.
  - Use it with Obsidian Mobile to track expenses as they occur on the go!
- [x] Auto suggest previous categories and expenses to speed entry.
- [ ] Reporting (planned soon!)
- [ ] Account reconciliation (planned soon!)
